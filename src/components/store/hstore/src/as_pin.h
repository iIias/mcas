/* Note: "pin", in this context, means to move key or mapped_type data from a

 * which will not move over its lifetime.
 */

/* Allocating space for a lockable value is tricky.
 *
 * The crash-consistent allocator uses the value of a persist_fixed_string::large_t::cptr
 * to determine whether an allocation should be rolled back or rolled forward.
 * The rule is that cptr == null rolls back and cptr != null rolls forward.
 * But in conversion from an inline value to a locakble value, cptr is not naturally null
 * before the store.
 * We pin that by
 *   1. Saving a copy of the original cptr before the allocation
 *   2. Setting cptr to null before the allocation
 *   3. After a crash, and if the allocation has not committed, restoring the saved value of cptr.
 *
 * To allocate space for a lockable value (when using Crash-consistent allocator), use these steps.
 * Allocation state "armed" means that the allocation_state object can properly handle a callback on restart to ask whether we own space at an address.
 *
 * An "allocation pointer" is a pointer which could be returned by the allocator. One characterisic of an "allocation pointer" is that it is 8-byte aligned.
 * V is the persist_fixed_string object to modify.
 * T is a temporary area, part of the allocation_state_pin object, of the size of V.
 *
 * (start state is S_unarmed)
 *   0. precondition: the "arm" pointer is null.
 *      (The allocation_state is not armed because its "arm" pointer is null.)
 *   1. Shallow copy V to T.
 *   2. Set the "arm" pointer to address of V
 *      (The allocation_state is now armed because the "arm" pointer is not null.
 *      The state may not and will not be queried in an allocator callback, though,
 *      until step 4 has begun.)
 * (S_unarmed->S_calling)
 *   3. Set V.cptr to null
 *   4. Allocate space from the allocator, to be stored at in V.cptr
 *      (The allocator records the cptr location as "in doubt" and, if a crash
 *      occurs, will call back to resolve the doubt.)
 * (S_calling->S_uncommitted)
 *      (The allocator write to V.cptr commits the operation.)
 * (S_uncommitted->S_comitted)
 *   5. Shallow copy the inline data area of T to *cptr, and set the "is_fixed" flag.
 *   6. Disarm the allocation_state_pin object (set the "arm" pointer to null.)
 * (S_committed->S_unarmed)
 *
 * Restart shall
 *   1. Handle any callback from the allocator, and note whether such a callback happened
 *   2. Determine the state (S0..S4)
 *   3. Perform an operation depending on the state
 *
 *   1. Handle and make note of a call back from the allocator.
 *     a. Note that the allocator has not yet made a callback
 *     b. Call allocator initialization.
 *        If callback occurs:
 *          i. Note that allocator has made a callback
 *          ii. return "owned" to the allocator iff the callback value matches arm_ptr->cptr, else "unowned"
 *
 *   2. Determine the state:
 *     S_unarmed: arm_ptr == NULL
 *     S_calling: arm_ptr != NULL and allocator has not made a callback
 *     S_uncommitted: arm_ptr != NULL and allocator has made a callback but the callback value did not match V.cptr (which was null)
 *     S_comitted: arm_ptr != NULL and allocator has made a callback and the callback value did match V.cptr
 *
 *   3. Perform an operation depending on the state:
 *     S_unarmed (unarmed): do nothing.
 *     S_calling (armed, allocator may have been called but had not yet marked the allocation "in doubt"): Roll back by shallow copy of T.cptr to V.cptr. Disarm the allocation_state_pin
 *     S_uncommitted (armed, allocator has been called but cptr not written): Roll back by shallow copy of T.cptr to V.cptr. Disarm the allocation_state_pin
 *     S_comitted (armed, allocator has written cptr): Roll forward by executing steps 5 and 6.
